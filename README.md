## How to contribute

### Writing blog posts
Check out the instructions here [TODO].

### Developing the website
1. Claim an [issue](https://github.com/UBC-iGEM/simplysynbio/issues).
2. You can either do your work on Codespaces, or locally.
  - If using Codespaces, open a Codespace, wait for the script to run, and then run `npm run develop`. This spins up a "local" version of the website at some URL generated by GitHub.
  - If locally, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
3. When you are done with your issue:
    1. Make a new branch with your name and the issue number. For instance, "lucy-4".
    2. Commit your changes with a message mentioning your issue number such as "done #4", please include the # because GitHub will automatically link that commit to the issue. Push you changes to that branch and open a PR. You are responsible for dealing with any merge conflicts. If your PR has merge conflicts I will not review it.
    3. If your changes are approved, I'll merge your branch into the master branch.

If you claim and issue and have not worked on it for 2 weeks, I'll check in. If you can't complete the issue I will unassign you.

Most issues are related to this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/RzhBu1jmK21fMMzofxSshe/SimplySynbio-Blog?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=iNl9B1xCUgCbwUg0-1). Ask Lucy for clarifying questions.

## üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a typical Gatsby project.

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-browser.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-node.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-ssr.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

1.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

1.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

1.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

1.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

1.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

1.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

1.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

1.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
