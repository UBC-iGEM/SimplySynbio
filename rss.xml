&lt;h2&gt;We Have a Lot of Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve all seen the warning that our Google Drive is reaching max capacity, and most of us delete a few documents, and move on with our lives. Everyone may store 10-15 GB of data on Google’s Cloud servers, and in addition to the massive scale of data that companies and universities collect, this quickly adds up. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/1624046/IDGE_Data_Analysis_2016_final.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the average enterprise has 347.56TB&lt;/strong&gt; of data&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, the amount of data we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globaldots.com/resources/blog/how-much-is-stored-in-the-cloud&quot;&gt;stored in the cloud&lt;/a&gt; is around 1 exabyte of data, or 1024 Petabytes of data, and this excludes other forms of storage such as cold storage. It’s not a bad thing to store lots and lots of information, in fact, storing copies of data is a good practice for preserving important information. The problem is that storing all this data has consequences on the planet, such as using up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/stanford-magazine/carbon-and-the-cloud-d6f481b79dfe&quot;&gt;2% of our global energy usage, and nearly 200 acres of land apiece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer scientists and engineers have tried to look for ways to make storage systems more compact and efficient, but are currently limited by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-tunneling-transistor&quot;&gt;laws of physics&lt;/a&gt;. This points to us needing to look else where for inspiration; one place to look is in fact, at the building blocks of nature: DNA. DNA is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/introduction-what-is-dna-6579978/&quot;&gt;“complex molecule that contains all of the information necessary to build and maintain an organism”&lt;/a&gt;. One thing that DNA excels at is being highly compact and dense, in fact, we can store all of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.mit.edu/2021/dna-data-storage-0610&quot;&gt;world’s information in a cup of DNA&lt;/a&gt;; engineers are no where near this level of compactness with current systems of storing data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Types of Storage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we start talking about DNA, we must highlight the different types of storage. Very generally, we have short term and long term storage. Short term storage allows for fast read and write access, at the expense of the data on the storage medium having a short lifetime. On the other hand, long term storage takes a long time to read and write data, with the advantage of very stable mediums for storing data for very long times. We currently store long term information in big data centres or cold storage forms such as on paper, which makes maintaining buildings to store this data and transporting these types of data a difficult task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When DNA is properly prepared and stored, it has a very stable shelf life. However, synthesizing and sequencing DNA with current technologies is very slow, making it a form of long term storage. As of now, working with DNA ex vivo is not the easist task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that our bodies have mastered the transportation and storage of DNA, partially due to the multiple levels of abstraction of DNA! First off, what is an abstraction? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/bio2.0/abstraction/&quot;&gt;Abstraction&lt;/a&gt; is an “engineering principle that allows us to ignore unnecessary details and focus only on a particular level of organization”. In synthetic biology, the first level of abstraction may be the DNA sequence made up of nucleotides. However, we may reuse certain sequences of DNA over and over, such as the DNA sequence for the GFP gene, which is a gene that glows green. Thus, we want to refer to that DNA sequence as a gene, which makes a gene the second level of abstraction. A gene is a type of data abstraction, whereas we will be talking about the &lt;em&gt;physical abstractions&lt;/em&gt; of DNA, which allow for DNA to be very compact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Physical Abstractions of DNA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we commonly refer to as DNA, actually has many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csbj.org/article/S2001-0370(23)00045-4/fulltext&quot;&gt;levels of physical abstraction&lt;/a&gt;, from chromosomes, to nucleosomes, and finally the DNA itself. But how compact are these DNA abstractions?&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very compact, in fact, Professor Yingjin Yuan states in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d42473-022-00319-3#:~:text=The%20largest%20human%20chromosome%20carries,microorganism%2C%20typically%20has%2016%20chromosomes&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“DNA has evolved to store massive quantities of information at very high density, and it’s remarkably stable, too. The largest human chromosome carries up to 250 million base pairs of DNA. If data could be stored on every base pair, all the data in the world could theoretically fit in a coffee mug,” says Yuan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chromosomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highest level of abstraction of DNA is a chromosome. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome&quot;&gt;chromosome&lt;/a&gt; is a package of DNA tightly coiled around proteins. Our bodies effortlessly move chromosomes throughout our body in order to direct the production of required proteins, as chromosomes are important for cellular division. Thus, the goal of a chromosome is to transport genetic materal from one generation to another. Chromosomes can contain any number of base pairs; in humans this ranges from around 50 million to 250 million base pairs. A chromosome of 250 base pairs contains around 59 MB and the human genome contains around 800 MB. Chromosomes also have unique 3D structures, which could provide the potential for humans to discover more complex ways of describing information such as files, books, or more using the same DNA sequence! Currently, we must rely on standards such as ASCII and Unicode to help us interpret a sequence of bits; if the 3D structure of a chromosome could directly tell us how to interpret a sequence of information this could open up ways of describing information in more unique ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nucleosomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second highest level of abstraction are nucleosomes, which are individual proteins that have a DNA wrapper around them; a chromosome is a multiple of many nucleosomes. When DNA forms a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/nucleosome-nucleosomes-30/#:~:text=A%20nucleosome%20is%20a%20section,resembles%20beads%20on%20a%20string&quot;&gt;complex with chromatin&lt;/a&gt;, it is referred to as a nucleosome, condensing it into smaller volume. Thus, nucleosomes help us keep DNA nicely folded and packed away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DNA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, the lowest level of abstraction is the DNA itself, which comprises of the four nucleotides, adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). Our team will be encoding, storing and decoding data at this level of abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our bodies have perfected the storage and transportation of long term data with DNA, we are yet to know how this exactly works. As of now, figuring out how these strategies work at the chemical and biological level are active areas of research, and how these mechanisms can be exploited for our use is another area of research we must tackle before we can use utilize structures like chromosomes or nucleosomes for storing our own types of data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Blood Stem Cell Breakthrough in Alzheimer's Research]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dysfunction in microglia.

&lt;p&gt;_Adapted from: &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2023/09/stem-cell-alzheimers.html&quot;&gt;https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2023/09/stem-cell-alzheimers.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ever-evolving landscape of medical research, a revolutionary breakthrough is offering new hope in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affecting millions of people globally, Alzheimer’s is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and personality changes. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “the number of people living with the diseases doubles every 5 years beyond age 65 which predicts the &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2023/09/stem-cell-alzheimers.html&quot;&gt;total number of patients to 14 million&lt;/a&gt; by 2060”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current intervention methods only include helping people maintain brain health, managing behavioral symptoms, or delaying symptoms of the disease. So how are Stanford Medicine researchers finding success in fighting this disease?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe a novel approach involving blood stem cell transplants is the answer. Blood stem cells, also known as hematopoietic stem cells, are responsible for producing all the different types of blood cells in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Promise of Blood Stem Cells&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Stanford Medicine, led by Marius Wernig, MD, PhD, have initiated a groundbreaking study published in Cell Stem Cell. Their work centers around a remarkable concept: replacing defective neural cells in mice with Alzheimer’s through blood stem cell transplants. This technique targets microglia, the brain’s innate immune cells crucial for maintaining neural health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Microglia and Alzheimer’s&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait – what are microglia, and why are they so important? Microglia act as the brain’s janitors, clearing out metabolic waste and defending against invaders. In Alzheimer’s disease, these cells can become dysfunctional, exacerbating the buildup of amyloid plaques – a hallmark of the disease. Wernig’s team focused in on a specific gene, TREM2, known for its critical role in microglial function. Mutations in TREM2 are strongly linked to increased Alzheimer’s risk, highlighting its pivotal role in disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Breakthrough Study: Lab Mice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their study, mice with defective TREM2 genes received transplants of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from healthy mice. These transplanted cells not only reconstituted the blood system, but also integrated into the brain as functional microglia, effectively replacing the diseased cells. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are crucial for generating all blood cell types, including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. The results? Amyloid plaques decreased, microglial function improved, and disease markers diminished – all from restoring the function of a single gene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Engineering Cells with Enhanced TREM2 Activity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wernig and his team didn’t stop there. They explored the potential of engineering cells with enhanced TREM2 activity, envisioning an even more therapeutic effect. The new microglia, though effective, differed slightly from natural ones, prompting further research to ensure unintended consequences are mitigated before human trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Challenges and Future Directions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For human trials, current procedures involve toxic chemotherapy or radiation to prepare patients for stem cell transplants, limiting widespread use. Yet, hope persists as researchers worldwide strive for safer, less invasive methods to facilitate such therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we look to the future, while the journey from mice to humans is steep, the breakthroughs made by Dr. Wernig and his team offer hope for millions affected by this disease. One day, perhaps sooner than we think, Alzheimer’s treatment could be revolutionized – not by pills, but by synthetic biology and therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Biosynthetic Sensors - A Synthetic Biology Tool for Environmental Protection]]></title><description><![CDATA[_Adapted from: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975023001465?via%3Dihub Every year environmental risk factors cause…]]></description><link>http://ubcigem.com/simplysynbio/Biosynthetic-Sensors/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://ubcigem.com/simplysynbio/Biosynthetic-Sensors/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span

&lt;p&gt;Every year environmental risk factors cause around 25% of human deaths. These factors include toxic pollutants that are often very difficult to identify and locate in order to remove. With no current cost-effective or simple solutions, emerging technology using synthetic biology holds the potential to be an effective tool for this complex problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Use Synthetic Biology&lt;/strong&gt;
Synthetic biology allows us to modify the genetic material of living organisms to portray desired characteristics. For example &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6952-2&quot;&gt;Brutesco et al’s (2017)&lt;/a&gt; team created microorganisms that were engineered to sense the presence of specific environmental pollutants in water and soil to track their quality. These biosensors are cost-effective and a simple solution to the expensive, and complex current approaches that require expensive laboratory equipment and technical expertise to produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are Biosythetic Sensors?&lt;/strong&gt;
Biosynthetic sensors are biological devices that contain a genetic element that can recognize toxic pollutants or other desired substances to produce a signal when paired with a reporter protein. This signal can be read and measured through relatively inexpensive equipment like spectrophotometers or with the naked eye if the signal is readily visible. The microorganisms within the sensor have their genome modified in order to produce a cellular response when the desired substance is present. Depending on the intensity of the substance presence, a stronger or weaker signal is produced which can be measured proportionally to the toxicity present in the sample of water or soil. Due to the variability or substance detection because of genetic editing technology combined with the inexpensive equipment required to receive the signal, biosynthetic sensors are a very effective solution to detecting environmental pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Applications&lt;/strong&gt;
Several biosynthetic sensors have been developed and are currently in use to monitor environmental pollutants. &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1111/1751-7915.12791&quot;&gt;Chang et al. (2017)&lt;/a&gt; developed a biosynthetic sensor to detect naphthalene, a substance that can cause &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-09/documents/naphthalene.pdf&quot;&gt;neurological and liver damage when ingested, in water and soil&lt;/a&gt;. Naphthalene is readily found in the air and soil as a result of using toxic pollutants in pesticides, burning biomass, smoking tobacco and many other readily used sources. Extensive exposure to the substance has been linked to many health effects such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph7072903&quot;&gt;hyperplasia and metaplasia in the respiratory tract&lt;/a&gt;. It is important that we can identify this dangerous chemical within the soil to prevent adverse health effects of extended exposure, and environmental pollution. Through the insertion of a gene called lux, the team successfully produced a biosensor that produced a bioluminescent signal once the microbes came in contact with naphthalene within the contaminated samples of water and soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Directions&lt;/strong&gt;
There are many other toxic pollutants that are present in soil and water, but some pollutants such as heavy metals are more challenging to identify with biosynthetic sensors. Specifically, differentiating between copper and nickel has been a challenge, but constant testing with different genetically modified biosensors are currently tackling this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;
Although biosensors are a cost-effective and simple solution to detecting environmental pollutants, there is limited application of them commercially due to their applicability on site locations, the time it takes to analyze the signals and other transportation costs. As we discover more about cellular functions and genes that we can implement to detect certain substances, these limitations can be overcome using genetic engineering to make the use of biosensors more widespread.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Synthetic Space Yeast for Radiation Protection]]></title><description><![CDATA[Baker's Yeast Under The Microscope.

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to this month’s SimplySynbio theme: space exploration! People have since long ago explored their curiosities of the world around us. One of these curiosities, space exploration, has unlocked many of these mysteries of our universe, improving life back on Earth and introducing the potential for life beyond Earth. Yet, the inhabitable environment of space poses several economical, technical, and health challenges for successful space exploration endeavours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Challenge: Radiation in Space&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most prominent long-term risks of space exploration is the exposure to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/cosmic.html#:~:text=Cosmic%20radiation%20consists%20of%20high,stars%2C%20including%20our%20own%20sun&quot;&gt;cosmic radiation&lt;/a&gt;. On Earth, we experience lower levels of cosmic radiation due to the  atmosphere and magnetic fields surrounding our planet. Beyond the Earth’s protective surfaces, we face much more dangerous and higher energy radiation from space that can directly damage our DNA – imagine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/missions/analog-field-testing/why-space-radiation-matters/&quot;&gt;taking 150 to 6,000 chest X-rays&lt;/a&gt; as you are in space. While spacecraft and spacesuits provide a form of barrier, they are not completely foolproof. Here is when synthetic biology and microorganisms jump in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introducing Yeast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeast, specifically &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.exploreyeast.com/what-is-yeast/what-is-saccharomyces-cerevisiae/&quot;&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/a&gt; (baker’s yeast), is a single-celled microorganism most well known for its fermentation properties in making bread, beer, and wine. As many of yeasts’ gene functions were derived from humans, it is extensively used as a model organism to study the biological processes in human cells. Therefore, there has been solid research in studying how yeast genes respond to DNA-damaging agents, such as cosmic radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Space Yeast!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2022, a cell biologist from the University of British Columbia, Corey Nislow, heard the news of his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ohscanada.com/opinions/studying-yeast-dna-in-space-may-help-protect-astronauts-from-cosmic-radiation/&quot;&gt;6000 bar-coded strains of baker’s yeast&lt;/a&gt; returning to Earth’s surface following a trip to the moon on NASA’s Artemis 1. In each yeast strain, one gene was deleted and a unique &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibol.org/about/dna-barcoding/&quot;&gt;DNA barcode&lt;/a&gt; sequence for identification purposes – if the deleted gene was responsible for cell growth and replication, the specific yeast strain would lag in growth when exposed to cosmic radiation in the space environment. Thus, as the scientists receive the yeast strains back, they can sequence the DNA and count the number of times each barcode appears, therefore studying each strain’s growth. Low counts of strains with specific genes deleted can indicate that those genes are potentially essential for survival against cosmic radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the samples produced from the Artemis 1 Mission will take decades to study and sequence through, the thriving population of yeast cells coming back from space showed promising results. With the knowledge of specific genes that are damaged or protected against cosmic radiation, we can then apply synthetic biology and genetic engineering principles to protect human DNA from radiation. For instance, some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/yeast-space-experiment-1.6711816&quot;&gt;insights and plans&lt;/a&gt; given by Nislow’s team include developing countermeasures that can allow the damaged yeast DNA to repair itself. Looking into the future, like mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, an mRNA countermeasure for cosmic radiation derived from yeast strains can be simply delivered into humans to equip us with the proper radiation protection. Not only would this be revolutionary for space exploration, but back on Earth, it can help cancer patients recover from radiation therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Synthetic biology + Space at iGEM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With just yeast, scientists (at UBC!) have demonstrated how synthetic biology principles can help humans combat the grand challenges of space travel. At iGEM, many teams tackled space exploration with their synthetic biology projects. In 2023, iGEM recognized the demand and introduced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.igem.org/blog/2023/4/5/q1prqwvrgiramrnwyj8hp3m9tdu3zr&quot;&gt;new village&lt;/a&gt;, or competition category, specifically dedicated to space projects. From iGEM and beyond, the future potential of synthetic biology applications to space exploration is exciting, groundbreaking, and inviting for scientists and engineers to explore it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Engineering Bacteria to Degrade Plastic in Salt Water]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

Photo taken from Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adapted from: &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aic.18228&quot;&gt;https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aic.18228&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plastic is everywhere. It’s what often houses our food and makes up a lot of the items that we own - it&apos;s even found in the air that we breathe and the water that we drink in the form of small bits of plastic that we can’t see with the naked eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grasp plastic has on our lives can be seen in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoceancleanup.com/ocean-plastic/#:~:text=Humans%20produce%20over%20400%20million,Less%20than%200.5%20percent%20.&quot;&gt;400 million metric tons&lt;/a&gt; of plastic that the world produces annually; and this number is projected to increase. From the 400 million metric tons, 0.5% (over 1 million tons) of plastic ends up in the ocean. A widely known example of plastic accumulation can be seen in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoceancleanup.com/great-pacific-garbage-patch/&quot;&gt;Great Pacific Garbage Patch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting rid of ocean plastic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plastic is hard to get rid of. Most of the commonly used plastics are non biodegradable and do not decompose when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700782&quot;&gt;accumulated in landfills or the natural environment&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the only way that we can deal with this huge amount of plastic is to burn it, which releases harmful toxins and gasses into the already-delicate atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the visible plastics that we can see floating in the ocean, microplastics exist as well. &lt;a href=&quot;https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/microplastics.html#:~:text=Plastic%20debris%20can%20come%20in,&quot;&gt;Microplastics&lt;/a&gt; are small pieces of plastic debris that are less than five millimeters in length. The small bits of plastics can float on the vast ocean water, sink to the bottom, or be eaten by marine life. To haul and get rid of the sheer amount of plastics that come in different sizes would take a mass effort that would only do more &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.education.nationalgeographic.org/2016/03/11/wait-a-minute-dont-clean-the-garbage-patch/&quot;&gt;harm than good&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A glimmer of hope&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyester terephthalate (PET) is an everyday plastic material that is 100% recyclable and are made out of long polymers, or chains of individual plastic molecules called monomers. A chain of monomers are classified as polymers. PETs are being extensively studied for their biodegradable characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complement this biodegradable characteristic of PET plastics, scientists have also found bacteria that have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000300537400027?SID=USW2EC0CD5lkgI2iq7OrhOw6irfT3&quot;&gt;PET degrading enzymes&lt;/a&gt; (PHEs); enzymes are proteins that help speed up the chemical reactions in an organism. Bacteria that have these PHEs are able to break the chains of plastic molecules existing in the PETs, a process called depolymerization. From these broken pieces, we can re-link the monomers to make plastics for a new purpose, which allows PET to be 100% recyclable. Repurposing already existing plastic is an energy-saving and environmentally-friendly alternative to current methods, such as burning plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have since been trying to engineer PHEs in bacteria to degrade PET plastics further than they already can. However, scientists have hit some roadblocks. Current PHE holding bacteria are unable to survive in environments with high concentrations of salt, which would be a problem for plastics that are in the ocean. As well, in order for PHE to degrade plastics, the bacteria must be lysed, or broken, to release the PHEs into the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using synthetic biology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aic.18228&quot;&gt;Li and his team&lt;/a&gt; were able to solve these problems by engineering a bacteria strain with PHE to survive in salty environments by using a new bacteria and by engineering the PHEs to go to the surface of the cell, rather than inside of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, scientists were working with Escherichia coli, a commonly used bacteria in synthetic biology due to its compliance to take up plasmids and fast growth. Li and his fellow scientist decided to use the even faster reproducing bacteria &lt;em&gt;Vibrio natriegens&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Vn&lt;/em&gt;), which is able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000896642900003?SID=USW2EC0CD5lkgI2iq7OrhOw6irfT3&quot;&gt;grow well in salt concentrations&lt;/a&gt; similar to that of the ocean, allowing it to be a suitable candidate for marine remediation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists then started working on engineering, or modifying the PHE itself. They first took a native PHE and modified it to include a signal molecule to send it to the surface of the bacterial cell. This modification was placed in a plasmid and inserted into the bacteria. A plasmid is a circular form of DNA that, when inserted into a host, will replicate and express itself independently; through this method, the bacteria will express the genetic instructions in the plasmid’s DNA. By sending the PHEs to the surface of the cell, the previous method of having to break the cell to release PHE is not needed anymore; this allows for the bacteria to lead a normal life cycle that includes reproduction for a more sustaining medium in breaking down PET plastics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By introducing the PHE + surface signal modification to &lt;em&gt;Vn&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers found that this engineered species was able to break down PET in salt water conditions without having to break the cells; this is a small step towards remediating the invasive plastics that live in our oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;There is still more work to be done…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Li and his team has made significant progress in the ocean-plastic journey by making the first genetically modified organism to break down PET in ocean-like conditions, there are still many roadblocks to making this a tangible solution. The modified bacteria is not enough to completely degrade PET particles efficiently; it would take around 24 years for this engineered bacteria to completely degrade 1g/L of PET particles. As well, PETs are widely used today, but this still does not mean there are other plastic types that reside in the ocean. Another direction would be finding ways to translate these findings to degrading non-PET plastics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building Science&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of PHEs that are able to withstand salt water is a very good example of how science is built upon the success of others. Science is based on collective learning. Within this story, there were scientists before Li’s team that found the PHEs necessary for Li and his team to incorporate them into a new bacterial medium. As well, without the previously developed engineering techniques, Li’s team would not have been able to find the tools they needed to carry out the engineering process. Similarly, Li’s team’s success and limitations also poses a new platform for future scientists and engineers to launch off of to hopefully create a solution to our current problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science and engineering are based on using the understanding, knowledge, and questions of our predecessors that we use to create answers that ultimately, will create more questions and start the scientific cycle all over again.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Coral reefs in the climate crisis: How synbio could use symbiotic relationships to build stronger ecosystems]]></title><description><![CDATA[Adapted from: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aba2498 In the discussion of climate change’s impacts on our world, you’ve likely…]]></description><link>http://ubcigem.com/simplysynbio/coral-reefs-in-the-climate-crisis/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://ubcigem.com/simplysynbio/coral-reefs-in-the-climate-crisis/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Feb 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adapted from: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aba2498&quot;&gt;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aba2498&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion of climate change’s impacts on our world, you’ve likely heard plenty about coral reefs. The increasing temperatures caused by greenhouse gases are heating up our oceans and damaging the coral. The microalgae that live in these coral reef systems flee when the heat becomes deadly for them, causing the coral to ‘bleach’, or, in other words, die due to a lack of nutrients.  Even if you really care about the ocean, you may still wonder— how far do the impacts of coral reef heating and bleaching go? And what does synthetic biology have to do with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A post from &lt;a href=&quot;https://reef-world.org/blog/no-coral-reefs&quot;&gt;The Reef-World Foundation&lt;/a&gt; says it all best. Beyond housing 25% of all marine life, coral reefs are vital to the economy through coastal fisheries and tourism, they protect coastlines from harsh conditions for people and animals alike, and they’re a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3976867/&quot;&gt;gold mine for medical research&lt;/a&gt;. Now that we’ve established the importance of coral reefs, it’s clear why the damage and death that heat and bleaching thrust upon them is dangerous. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aba2498&quot;&gt;Bueger et al.&lt;/a&gt; approached solving this problem with a microalgae that commonly lives in symbiosis with coral, which shows promise for synthetic biology applications in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making stronger friendships&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symbiosis is when two organisms live together in a relationship, whether neutral, good, or bad, and in this case, synthetic biology will be enhancing the good. Within one of the parties of this symbiotic relationship, there can be another relationship existing within the organism, called endosymbiosis. Coral and microalgae are in a symbiotic relationship where the coral’s structure protects the microalgae and the microalgae provides energy via photosynthesis for the coral to grow itself. However, under too much heat, the microalgae will leave and cause bleaching in the coral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bueger and his team decided to work on the microalgae because they are fast at reproducing and responsible for providing nutrients to the coral. Once changed, they can quickly reproduce and spread the change across the coral reef systems they’re a part of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evolve the microalgae, Bueger and his team used exposure to heat over 4 years to get the microalgae to adapt to warmer temperatures through building natural resilience - kind of like how you might get someone to overcome their fears by facing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, a pleasant discovery was made. In testing the heat-exposed microalgae against normal microalgae, not only did they survive and function better in the heat than their non-evolved counterparts, but three microalgae strains also produced less reactive oxygen species— the chemicals which lead coral to bleach! Not only did the team find a way to protect coral from the rising temperatures, they also found a way to protect the coral from the microalgal response to heat with three particular microalgae strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working together&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, to put it all together, the modified microalgae were introduced into coral larvae and subjected to warmer conditions (31°C) again as they grew. It was found that coral gained the benefits of functioning and growing normally at higher temperatures from their symbiotic relationship with the microalgae. One strain of microalgae in particular, dubbed ‘SS8’, showed especially good results because of its uniquely effective response to warmer conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is true with most science there is still more research to be done. Can the coral and microalgae survive properly when temperatures drop outside of summer, or are they only capable of working in warmth? What’s their longevity? These are a couple of the questions raised by Bueger et al., but one more could come to mind: What if we genetically modified the microalgae instead of ‘training’ it to be heat tolerant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetically-enhanced teamwork&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s still extremely important to tackle climate change at the source, synthetic biology helps ecosystems adapt to the changes that have already resulted from it. Synthetic biology is all about modifying organisms to adapt to new conditions. Think of it like enforcing a beneficial genetic mutation and significantly speeding up what would come through luck after years of evolution. So what if we could use this knowledge to help coral to persist in warmer conditions, and even resist bleaching? Instead of heat training microalgae repeatedly over time, we could use the heat tolerant microalgae as a blueprint to modify microalgae to do exactly as we need, like becoming resilient to year round temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these possibilities are still early in testing, as synthetic biology is a quickly developing but relatively new field. Research on using synthetic biology for coral is something to keep an eye out for in our near future!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Introducing our new initiative...

&lt;p&gt;Our HP team is a small subteam that belongs to the wider UBC iGEM team. Our subteam considers how the research done by our iGEM team impacts society and vice versa. We focus on science outreach and communication, education, ethics, and safety considerations of synthetic biology, both in general and for our project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our wider team competes in the annual iGEM Jamboree, a big synthetic biology competition. iGEM stands for “International Genetically Engineered Machine,” and it’s an MIT-founded competition that brings in over 500 teams across the world to try and solve problems ranging from something as big as space travel to something close to home like trying to target small cancer cells for therapeutics - all with synthetic biology!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply Synbio is a project built upon what our 2023 UBC iGEM team created in the past year. The past team was able to communicate science through an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH2Rd_OYp_Q&amp;#x26;t=1s&amp;#x26;ab_channel=UBCiGEM&quot;&gt;animated video series&lt;/a&gt;; our team would like to carry on that torch, but with two new platforms - this blog and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this blog, we would like you to join us in exploring new advances in science. Members of our team will be volunteering their time to break down new breakthroughs in biological engineering so that we can all enjoy and celebrate the cool science that is happening around us. Each blog post will be accompanied by an Instagram post that is even further condensed; you can find our Instagram &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/simplysynbio/&quot;&gt;@simplysynbio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s that. Please stay tuned for our first official post coming soon… I hear it has something to do with the ocean!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take care,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yejin, on behalf of the UBC iGEM Human Practices subteam&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
